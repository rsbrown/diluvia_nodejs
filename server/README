This is the server application.

You'll need NPM modules:

  * express
  * socket.io
  * ejs
  
You'll also need a running redis server. If you have MacPorts, install it with:

  $ sudo port install redis

  $ redis-server

Run it with:

  $ node app.js
  
It will show up on port 3000:

  http://localhost:3000/
